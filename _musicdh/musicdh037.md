blurb: Sounding Tennyson presents sonic and textual versions of one of Tennyson’s
  most famous poems, Break, Break, Break. The Music section on our site shows images
  of musical scores (mostly by Tennyson’s wife, Emily) and gives the option to play
  the songs, with each measure marked in time with the music. Users can compare any
  one musical setting to other musical and textual drafts. The scores can be silently
  examined through the Music or Archives tab, which includes all the digitized items
  featured on Sounding Tennyson. An Earwitness section contains observers' accounts
  of listening to Tennyson or his family recite and the poet's response to hearing
  his poetry set to music. Following the Essays link brings up short articles, both
  highly specific to the poem and contextual.
