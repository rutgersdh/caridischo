blurb: The Bellini Digital Correspondence (BDC) project is creating a digital critical
  edition of Vincenzo Bellini's autograph letters preserved at the Museo civico Belliniano
  in Catania. The correspondence includes 40 multi-page documents reproduced in over
  100 digital images. The BDC project is pedagogical in focus; a large portion of
  the corpus has been encoded by interns and doctoral students at the University of
  Pisa. For this reason, the first encodings were not uniform and required careful
  harmonization for the creation of this edition. On the whole, the project has required
  several editorial phases for the production, analysis, processing, presentation,
  and use of the Bellinian repertory under investigation. The model proposed in this
  edition is curatorial and uncontroversial and therefore reusable in similar contexts.
  The BDC is completely open source and open access.
