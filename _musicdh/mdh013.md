blurb: Software application for optical recognition, superimposition, and collation
  of early music prints. Aruspix has been developed with early typographic music prints
  in mind, meaning mainly those scores printed during the 16th and 17th centuries
  with movable typefaces. Such scores are often difficult to examine with existing
  superimposition and optical recognition software, as they present a number of specific
  layout and format problems and are quite often in a deteriorated state because of
  their age.
