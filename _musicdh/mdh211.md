blurb: |-
  <i>Catalogue of French Chansons</i> is a database dedicated to the Renaissance French chanson from 1480ca to the beginning of the seventeenth century. The database collects 9723 songs incipits (text and music), and gives information about the composer, the scoring, the literary and musical sources, and the literary form.<br><br>
  The database was created in 1992 by Annie Cœurdevey. She started by including in the database the references from the catalogue by Hubert Daschner, <em>Die gedruckten mehrstimmigen Chansons von 1500-1600. Literarische Quellen und Bibliographie</em> (PhD Dissertation, University of Bonn, 1962), and then she verified and completed the study of the sources. Specifically she discovered many titles of chansons in manuscripts sources dating 1480-1500, and added to the database the monodic chansons from the Bayeux and Paris 12744 manuscripts.
