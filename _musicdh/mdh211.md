blurb: "<i>Partitura</i> is a lightweight Python package for handling symbolic musical
  information. It provides easy access to features commonly used in music information
  retrieval tasks, like note arrays (lists of timed pitched events) and 2D piano roll
  matrices, as well as other score elements such as time and key signatures, performance
  directives, and repeat structures. Partitura can load musical scores (in MEI, MusicXML,
  Humdrum **kern, and MIDI formats), MIDI performances, and score-to-performance alignments.
  The package includes some tools for music analysis, such as automatic pitch spelling,
  key signature identification, and voice separation. Documentation may be found at
  <a href='https://partitura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'>https://partitura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>."
