blurb: |-
  Radio Free Stein stages the plays of Gertrude Stein in the medium of recorded sound. Our goals are to study Steinâ€™s lesser-known theatrical work, to understand the relevance of music and sound to her poetics, and to expand ways of integrating words with other sonic elements.

  Here you can find original audio recordings, liner notes on productions, interpretations of the plays, and other resources on Gertrude Stein and sound.
