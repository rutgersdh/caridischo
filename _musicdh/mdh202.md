blurb: Between 1848 and 1888, several members of the Echeverría family compiled and
  collected a total of 78 music scores in a binder’s volume. This bound collection
  of musical scores and other miscellaneous documents belonged to sisters Ana and
  Cristina Echeverría, who performed the music contained in this binder’s volume at
  salon gatherings held in Bogotá. Printed and handwritten, the sheet music found
  in Ana and Cristina Echeverría's binder’s volume feature works by composers such
  as José María Ponce de León (Bogotá, Colombia), and Jesús María Suárez (Caracas,
  Venezuela), as well the music of Ana and Cristina's cousin, Rosa Echeverría (Santa
  Marta, Colombia). This digital exhibition tells the story of this binder’s volume
  and of its owners. The exhibition also explores the music practices formed around
  this musical object, the sonic and material flows materialized in the sheet music
  itself, and everything else that can be told about this particular binder’s volume
  that accompanied the Echeverria family’s evenings throughout the mid-to-late 19th
  century.
