blurb: The Class of 1982 Sequentiary is a book — donated to the MIT Lewis Music Library
  by the MIT Class of 1982 — from the 15th or early 16th century that contains text
  and music of a genre of chants called “sequences.” The singing of sequences was
  largely removed from the Catholic Mass during the reforms of the Counter-Reformation,
  and thus intact sequentiaries are quite rare. This project was an experiment created
  to support the Medieval and Renaissance Music (21M.220) class taught by Professor
  Michael Cuthbert for Spring 2017.
