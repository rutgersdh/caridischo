blurb: The Class of 1982 Sequentiary is a book — donated to the MIT Lewis Music Library
  by the MIT Class of 1982 — from the 15th or early 16th century that contains text
  and music of a genre of chants called “sequences.” The singing of sequences was
  largely removed from the Catholic Mass during the reforms of the Counter-Reformation,
  and thus intact sequentiaries are quite rare. This project was an experiment created
  to support the Medieval and Renaissance Music (21M.220) class taught by Professor
  Michael Cuthbert for Spring 2017.
notes: This project uses the Mirador viewer and IIIF.
