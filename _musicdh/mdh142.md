blurb: A split-leaf psalter is a printed volume in which the pages are cut in half
  in the middle so that the upper half forms a booklet of tunes, and the lower a booklet
  of texts. This layout would allow readers to match the texts with the tunes that
  they know best. Just like a traditional printed split-leaf, the Digital Splitleaf
  uses the latest in digital technology to bridge the split, so to speak. It empowers
  you to select the metrical Psalm texts and tunes that you would like to sing. However,
  once a tune and psalm text have been selected, the Digital Splitleaf Psalter underlays
  your selected text beneath the music as you would expect from a more traditional
  psalter or hymnal. This makes reading the music and psalm text much simpler.
