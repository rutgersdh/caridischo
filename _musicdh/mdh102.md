blurb: The American Society for Jewish Music traces its roots back to the 1908 founding
  of The Society for Jewish Folk Music in St. Petersburg, the first Jewish musical
  institution permitted in Russia. With its emphasis on folkloric collection, new
  Jewish music composition and performance, over time the Society included such young
  composers as Joseph Achron, Michail Gnesin, Alexander Krein, Moshe Milner, Solomon
  Rosowsky and Lazare Saminsky, among others, and it nurtured their work through its
  own publishing arm.Thanks to the efforts of Sam Zerin, a recent graduate of the
  University of Michigan and now a graduate student at New York University, and the
  generous cooperation of the Jewish Theological Seminary and Gratz College, and project
  advisors Judith Pinnolis and Paula Eisenstein-Baker, the full run of these scores,
  most of which are long since out of print, will now be available again, this time
  online, through the ASJMâ€™s St. Petersburg Score Project. Making the St. Petersburg
  scores available, as well as the publications of the successor publishers, Juwal
  and Jibneh with offices in Berlin and Tel Aviv, not only provides important documentation
  of the work of Jewish composers during the early twentieth century, but will also
  provide access to these works for interested performers and scholars worldwide.
