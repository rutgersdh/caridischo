blurb: |-
  The Global Jukebox (GJB) is an ever-expanding database of traditional folk, indigenous, and popular songs from cultures around the world. It is a space to connect with our deep heritage through the expressive arts of singing, dancing, and conversing. It is dedicated to the world's peoples and cultures, and to their models (ideals) of beauty, and forms of communicating and bonding.
  <br>
  Data visualized on the Global Jukebox reveals relationships between expressive systems and the pathways of song and movement styles across the globe. It posits relationships between performance and social factors.
  <br>
  All regions and areas of world culture are represented on the GJB. With over 6000 songs from 1200 cultures, there are many examples for every region, every people. Thus, the user can discover the rich variety and inventiveness, as well as the unifying similarities, of singing and music making within a region of culture, or amongst a people. They can begin to feel the workings of a culture by listening to its music. <br> The project makes available datasets and teaching resources on Choreometrics and Cantometrics.
