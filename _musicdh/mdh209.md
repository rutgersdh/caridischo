blurb: |-
  <i>Singing upon the Book in the Renaissance</i> is a website dedicated to the oral practice of counterpoint in the early modern period. It makes available to our community of music lovers, musicians and researchers various tools for the study of polyphonic improvisation from the end of the Middle Ages to the end of the 18th century.
  <br><br>
  The website also includes the edition in modern clefs of the musical examples contained in the <i>De arte de contrapunto and the Introdutione facilissima</i> (1553) of the portuguese composer Vicente Lusitano. Out of the 250 music examples that can be dowloaded in pdf format, 60 of them have been recorded by the ensemble Les Sacqueboutiers, and are available in mp3 format. An English translation of Lusitano’s Tratado de canto de organo is also available.
