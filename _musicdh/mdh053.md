blurb: The Italian Opera Aria on the London Stage is based on the surviving libretti,
  both printed and manuscript, for operas in Italian performed in London. It provides
  a mechanism by which aria texts can be traced through different libretti, as they
  were moved from one opera to another by impresarios, conductors, and singers.
