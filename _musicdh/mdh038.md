blurb: The Marenzio Online Digital Edition (MODE) is a critical edition of the secular
  music of Luca Marenzio (ca. 1553-1599), one of the most influential composers of
  the European Renaissance. MODE is the product of an international collaboration
  that started in 2006 with a conference held at Harvard University, the proceedings
  of which were later published by Brepols. In 2011 the project was awarded a grant
  from the National Endowment for the Humanities.
