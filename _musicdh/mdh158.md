  work. Users seeking a work by catalogue number can consult the &quot;Search&quot;
  tab. Non-transferable performing parts can be ordered at the Performing Materials
  tab without cost on request. This series, which now includes links to facsimiles,
  the composer's autobiography, a catalog of his <i>Nachlass</i>, and a scan of Alfred
  Wotquenne's thematic catalog, is nearing completion.
