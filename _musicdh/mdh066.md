blurb: The Berkeley Folk Music Festival Project is a multimodal investigation of an
  understudied folk music festival that took place between 1958 and 1970 on the campus
  of the University of California. The Project includes a fully digitized repository
  of roughly 33,500 artifacts, an introductory exhibition, and (in development) a
  series of multimedia essays, an audio podcast series, an oral history repository,
  lesson plans for teachers, seminars taught by project director and historian Dr.
  Michael J. Kramer (SUNY Brockport), and an in-person gallery exhibit and book.
