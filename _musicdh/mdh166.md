blurb: |-
  This site is the product of a design sprint conducted by Emma Solloway with supervision from Cal Murgu, Digital Humanities Librarian, and Professor Mark Dancigers, Assistant Professor of Music and Digital Media, in January 2020 at the New College of Florida.
  <br>
  This project aims to create and experiment with using audio and visual connection as an alternative way to presenting data. In this case, students were surveyed about locations on campus and a composite of the average sentiment was used to create music that aims to represent the data collected. As you manuever through the website, consider how the music reflects the quantified sentiment.
