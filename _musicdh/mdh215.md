blurb: A DEI-centered classical music organization that promotes justice and curiosity
  through performance, education, and scholarship of composers from historically-underrepresented
  backgrounds. The site uses a database of composers structured as a directed graph
  to make recommendations, &quot;focus on composers that have been systematically
  excluded from the canon&quot;, and includes an interactive timeline, a playlist,
  and a professionally-recorded album.
