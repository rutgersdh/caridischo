blurb: The Melisma Music Analyzer is a program for analyzing music and extracting
  information from it. The analyzer takes a piece represented as an &quot;event list&quot;--a
  list of notes, with pitch, on-time, and off-time--and sometimes other input as well.
  It then subjects this input to various kinds of analysis and processing.
