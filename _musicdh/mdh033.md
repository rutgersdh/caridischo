blurb: This project presents, for the first time, digitisations of polyphonic compositions
  written during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in mensural notation, linked
  directly, in most cases, to high-resolution images of the original manuscript sources.
  It offers new possibilities for mediating the scholarly and public experience of
  this richly evocative music within its original context.
