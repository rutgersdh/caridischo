blurb: The Open Music Library is an initiative from Alexander Street to build the
  world’s largest free index of digital resources for the study of music. Curated
  by a community of music scholars, students, teachers and librarians, the Open Music
  Library brings together peer-reviewed journal articles, books and music scores from
  the world’s digital collections. Leveraging shared ontologies, linked open data
  and principles of the semantic web, the Open Music Library integrates disparate
  digital collections and establishes meaningful links between the items they hold.
