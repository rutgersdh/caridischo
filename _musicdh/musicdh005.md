blurb: Developed by historian Laurent Dubois, PhD candidate in English Mary Caton
  Lingold, and composer-scholar David Garner, Musical Passage uses a digital format
  to explore a unique artifact of early African diasporic music. The site is designed
  around two pages from eighteenth-century British naturalist and collector Hans Sloaneâ€™s
  A Voyage to the Islands (1707), which documents his time in Jamaica in the late
  1680s.
