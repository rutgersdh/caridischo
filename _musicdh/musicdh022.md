blurb: This music data repository is focused on works by under-represented people
  and the aim is to decenter the musical canon and make data-driven music scholarship
  more diverse and inclusive. In particular, this repository will contain a dataset
  of compositions spanning a large historical period by an under-represented group
  (primarily women and people of color) that has generally been left out of (big)
  data driven scholarship work.
