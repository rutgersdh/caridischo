blurb: The Digital Interactive Mozart Edition (DIME) aims at being the first fully
  digital edition of Wolfgang Amadé Mozart's musical works. While the music is encoded
  in the XML format of the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI), accompanying texts may
  be encoded in TEI or in other machine-readable formats. The core of DIME consists
  in digitally re-mastered representations of the musical text of the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe,
  updated and enriched for online display. In a second approach, DIME also offers
  new editions of selected works that are digitally edited entirely from scratch.
  DIME uses its own web interface, MoVi – The digital Mozart score viewer, for rendering.
