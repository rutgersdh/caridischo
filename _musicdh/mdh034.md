blurb: Meico is a converter framework for MEI files. Even though MEI is a quasi-standard
  for digital music editions, there is little software support for it. Processing
  MEI encoded music is not a trivial task and many application scenarios have their
  own more established and efficient formats. With meico we address these issues.
  Meico implements methods to convert MEI data to several other formats, making MEI
  encodings accessible to a variety of applications.
