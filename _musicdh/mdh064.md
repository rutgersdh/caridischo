blurb: Telemeta is a free and open source collaborative multimedia asset management
  system (MAM) which introduces fast and secure methods to archive, backup, transcode,
  analyse, annotate and publish any digitalized video or audio file with extensive
  metadata. It is dedicated to collaborative media archiving projects, research laboratories
  and digital humanities - especially in ethno-musicological use cases - who need
  to easily organize and publish documented sound collections of audio files, CDs,
  digitalized vinyls and magnetic tapes over a strong database, through a smart and
  secure platform, in accordance with open web standards.
