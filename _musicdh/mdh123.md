blurb: Sekuru’s Stories is a digital monograph featuring the music, stories, and life
  history of Tute Chigamba, a renowned Zimbabwean musician. Sekuru Chigamba’s stories
  also introduce readers to the diverse world of Zimbabwean musical practice. Sekuru
  Chigamba’s primary instrument is the <i>mbira dzavadzimu,</i> or mbira of the ancestral
  spirits. Played during all-night ceremonies called <i>mapira,</i> the mbira is instrumental
  in summoning the ancestral spirits to possess living mediums, known as <i>masvikiro.</i>
  Once the spirits have arrived, mbira players often shift to a softer, slower style
  of playing in order to accompany consultations between the ancestors and their living
  descendants.
