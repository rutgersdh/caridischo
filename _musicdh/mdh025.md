blurb: The project aims to combine two of the most current research areas in music
  philology – the exploration of the genesis of musical works incorporated in texts
  of varying completeness. The projected multi-perspective focus becomes a central
  musicological research topic for gaining a differentiated picture of the text-in-progress,
  making it visible and reflecting it critically. Significant insights are anticipated
  for evaluating the entire compositional history and aesthetics of the 19th and 20th
  century crucially founded on Beethoven. The project is organized in a set of five
  modules, each concentrating on different aspects of compositional processes, musical
  variance, and reorganization of musical material found in Beethoven’s works. Each
  module builds on its predecessors, with the last showing the full potential of digital
  editions by combining a traditional edition of the work, a source edition and a
  genetic edition of the work’s text. These editions will all be prepared and edited
  using the Edirom tools, whereas on the data layer, everything will be encoded in
  MEI. The project aims to trace the textual development very closely, so that information
  beyond the current level of detail provided by MEI is required.
