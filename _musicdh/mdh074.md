blurb: The recorded legacy of jazz spans a century and provides a vast corpus of data
  documenting its development. Recent advances in digital signal processing and data
  analysis technologies enable automatic recognition of musical structures and their
  linkage through metadata to historical and social context. Automatic metadata extraction
  and aggregation give unprecedented access to large collections, fostering new interdisciplinary
  research opportunities. This project aims to develop innovative technological and
  music-analytical methods to gain fresh insight into jazz history by bringing together
  renowned scholars and results from several high-profile projects. Musicologists
  and computer scientists will together create a deeper and more comprehensive understanding
  of jazz in its social and cultural context. We exemplify our methods via a full
  cycle of analysis of melodic patterns, or <i>licks</i>, from audio recordings to
  an aesthetically contextualised and historically situated understanding.
