blurb: The Turkish Makam Music Symbolic Data Collection (SymbTr) is designed for analysis
  of encoded repertories and is currently the largest repertory of its kind. It offers
  2,200 pieces from 155 makams, 88 usuls, 56 forms, about 865,000 musical notes (80
  hours of nominal playback time). Makam is a system of intervalic relationships and
  melodic development types widely used in Turkish, Persian, and Arabic music. This
  set of encoded scores, based on pieces from Turkish art and folk music, is based
  on authoritative sources. It covers a broad historical time span among pieces which
  are still performed in today.
