blurb: 'The Sonic Glossary is an innovative teaching tool for music appreciation.
  It assumes no musical training on the part of the user. It defines musical terms
  by combining visual text, spoken voice, pictures, graphic images, and musical sound
  in creative ways, delivering them in high-quality audio for private study. The Sonic
  Glossary does not replace classroom teaching: at Columbia University Music Humanities
  is taught by small-group discussion, which the Sonic Glossary reinforces and amplifies.
  Definitions are written by the teaching staff of Music Humanities, sound is recorded
  and mixed by the Computer Music Center, and the illustrations and animations are
  generated at CCNMTL. The finished components are then compiled and released on the
  Web. The Sonic Glossary contains over 75 entries.'
