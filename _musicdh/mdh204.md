blurb: Virtual Music Heritage is a website devoted to music heritage research and
  interactive installations by Ricercar — the musicology team of the Center for Renaissance
  Studies (<a href='https://cesr.cnrs.fr/' target='_blank'>CESR</a>) in Tours, France.<br
  />Since 2010, we have been working on various projects dedicated to raising awareness
  of our music heritage research in conjunction with private and public museums and
  cultural institutions.</p><p>We currently have three ongoing programmes:</p><p>1)
  The <em>Cubiculum musicae</em> — a mobile interactive space equipped with HiFi and
  HD where visitors can immerse themselves in the sights and sounds of the Renaissance.<br
  />2) <em>Music in Renaissance Palaces</em> — research-based recreation of the acoustic
  of spaces designed for playing music, thanks to the collaboration of ensembles specialized
  in specific Renaissance and Baroque repertoires.<br />3) Interactive 3D reconstructions
  of lost architectures with sound spatialization.</p>
