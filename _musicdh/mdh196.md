blurb: We are investigating the use of song to register protest through the ages,
  from 1600 to 2020. The core of the website is its database of 750 protest songs
  from 1600–2020, of which 250 are showcased as the most distinctive and important.
  These are the ‘curated’ songs you will see by default. We have kept in basic information
  about the other 500 to allow you to explore further. A number of these are more
  debatable as ‘English’, ‘protest’ – or even ‘songs’! The 750 were chosen by the
  project team with help from fifty-five contributing experts.<br><br>We are not simply
  documenting these songs. We want to show how and why music, in the form of song,
  has been used as a type of political communication. For us, each protest song need
  to be understood as part of a specific political and musical moment, mediated by
  multiple processes and possibilities. This subtler story is essential to understanding
  why and when musicians have intervened and continue to intervene in politics, and
  the form taken by these interventions.
