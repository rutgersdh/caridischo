blurb: 'The period covered by this project found Americans across a wide range of
  classes, occupations, and regions learning to read and notate music. Ordinary citizens
  bought copybooks (often pre-ruled with musical staves) or fashioned their own and
  then inscribed in them the songs, hymns, and tunes that mattered to them, music
  they had composed, performed, heard, or wanted to learn. Their work has come down
  to us as prima facie evidence of musical lives desired or lived. &quot;American
  Vernacular Music Manuscripts, ca. 1730-1910: Digital Collections from the American
  Antiquarian Society and the Center for Popular Music&quot; has been made possible
  in part by a major grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities: Exploring
  the Human Endeavor.'
