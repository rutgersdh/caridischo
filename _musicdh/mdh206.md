blurb: Corpus of 15th-Century Anonymous Masses is an online edition of polyphonic
  masses composed by anonymous musicians who worked in fifteenth-century European
  chapels. The database collects the critical editions of 142 masses (30 available
  online) and 147 isolated movements (1 available online), mainly preserved in Italian
  manuscripts (37 sources). Downloading is available free of charge, with scores and
  critical notes in pdf files. This is a project in progress, periodically enriched
  with new editions.
