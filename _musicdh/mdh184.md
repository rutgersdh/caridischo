blurb: "The long thirteenth century was characterised by a vernacular musico-poetic
  culture in which short fragments of text and/or music circulated within and between
  songs of various types (chanson à refrain, chanson avec des refrains, rondeau),
  the motet repertory, the romance and a host of other types that impinged on music,
  literature or both. Controlling the repertory can be time-consuming and problematic:
  assembling the material to examine even a single family of refrains can involve
  the identification, location and manipulation of large amounts of material.\n<br>
  <br>\nSince the middle of the nineteenth century, scholars of French literature
  have been identifying refrains in the single text on which they were working, but
  it was not until 1964 that Friedrich Gennrich published the first attempt at a catalogue,
  an experiment that was amplified in 1969 by Nico H. J. van den Boogaard. Both these
  works were catalogues, and van den Boogaard’s was also an edition of the texts of
  the refrains. Music was not mentioned in the catalogue and not edited. Both these
  shortcomings were rectified in Anne Ibos-Augé's dissertation, ‘La fonction des insertions
  lyriques dans des œuvres narratives et didactiques aux xiiième et xivème siècles’.
  \n<br> <br> REFRAIN seeks to integrate these pre-existing work on the refrain into
  a single, searchable, database and to bring the data up to date. It indexes not
  only the location of the refrain in its song, motet, romance or other context but
  delivers the exact manuscript reading for every occurrence of every refrain in every
  manuscript source."
