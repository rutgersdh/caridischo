blurb: The corrido is a genre of narrative song popular in Mexico and parts of the
  American Southwest. Using rhythms learned from German immigrants in the nineteenth
  century, corridos tell a variety of stories, from folk heroic exploits to the struggles
  of workers, to reactions to new technologies, to celebrations of places and peoples.
  This project draws on Gloria Anzaldúa’s characterization of these songs as &quot;cultural
  mythmakers,&quot; treating them as artefacts and acts of living folklore. In doing
  so, we highlight their identity-creating affordances and center their role as bearers
  of culture, history, and social relationships. Corridos are still actively composed
  and performed today. Our archive is representative of what was performed, collected,
  and recirculated in the first quarter of the twentieth century.
