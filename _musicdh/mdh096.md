blurb: |-
  In an effort to make early harp music available to the community, the International Harp Archives is digitizing much of its pre-1923 harp music, where it can be downloaded free of cost. These scores are made available through the Wiki and the International Harp Archives Database (accessible through the &quot;Search Database&quot; tab).
  <br>
  Items on the Wiki are listed by composer and provide basic information while Database items can be searched by keyword, composer, year, dedicatee, etc. Database records contain a full MARC record, including the itemâ€™s call number in our library, which is useful if patrons require higher-quality scans of an item or wish to examine it in person.
