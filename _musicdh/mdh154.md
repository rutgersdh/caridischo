blurb: LITMUS (Linked Irish Traditional Music) seeks to improve searching and access
  to web-based Irish traditional music, song and dance resources. The goal of the
  LITMUS project was to develop linked data tools to better express what occurs within
  oral transmission. While tailored to Irish traditional music, it is hoped that this
  project will provide a working model for other European and non-European traditional
  musics.
