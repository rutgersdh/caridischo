blurb: 'The Josquin Research Project (JRP) changes what it means to engage with Renaissance
  music. Our open-access website not only hosts an ever-growing collection of complete
  scores, but for the first time makes the music fully searchable: in a few clicks
  you can identify every instance of a given melodic and/or rhythmic pattern. The
  JRP also provides analytical tools that can be used to gain insight into individual
  works, the style of a given composer, or the musical lingua franca. The goal of
  the project is to facilitate a new kind of knowing that brings &quot;big data&quot;
  into conversation with traditional analytical methods.'
