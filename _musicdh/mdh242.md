blurb: The Clausula Archive of the Notre Dame Repertory (CANDR) is an in-progress
  project with the aim of cataloguing, transcribing and analysing digital facsimiles
  of the thirteenth-century repertory commonly termed Notre Dame polyphony, and a
  secondary aim of providing new datasets and analytical tools for studying medieval
  polyphony. CANDR is an online and open source database for thirteenth-century polyphony,
  augmented by an optical music recognition (OMR) and editing tool.
