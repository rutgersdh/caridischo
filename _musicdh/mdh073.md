blurb: The Anton Webern Gesamtausgabe (AWG) is a critical-historical edition which
  aims to make Webern’s entire oeuvre accessible to musical scholarship and practice
  in a scholarly form. The edition includes not only all the works Webern himself
  had forwarded to be printed but also their unpublished variants. It also includes
  compositions that were never made public in his lifetime, works from his youth and
  student years, as well as fragments, sketches, arrangements and revisions of his
  and other scores.
