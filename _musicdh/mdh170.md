blurb: Cantus Index is a catalogue of chant texts and melodies for the liturgical
  Office and Mass. Through the use of unique &quot;Cantus ID numbers,&quot; multiple
  online medieval music databases have been networked together in order that chant
  texts and melodies can be searched on this Cantus Index website and matches in all
  of the partner databases will be returned.
