blurb: The FTCO provides free public access to a thematic catalogue and database of
  all the known works of Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583-1643), including works of uncertain
  or mistaken attribution, along with all their early sources (up to approximately
  1800), principal modern editions, and associated literature. It is a work-in-progress
  and may remain so for some time to come. We hope that with ongoing contributions
  and comments from the international musical and scholarly community, we will continue
  to improve the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and usefulness of the database.
