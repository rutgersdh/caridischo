blurb: The Inventions of Note Sheet Music Collection was established in 1997 by the
  Lewis Music Library at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This sheet music
  collection consists of popular songs and piano compositions that portray technologies
  (old and new alike) as revealed through song texts and/or cover art. Today we take
  for granted such inventions as the automobile, airplane, radio, and telephone; they
  have become part of our daily lives. However, the initial appearance of these and
  other inventions created a myriad of responses in American society ranging from
  excitement and delight to anxiety and scorn. This collection reflects those varied
  reactions through the medium of popular music publications.
