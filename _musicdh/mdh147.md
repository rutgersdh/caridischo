blurb: Weber’s <i>Freischütz</i>, as an exemplary pilot project following the draft
  of a concept derived from Frans Wiering’s <i>Multidimensional Model</i> of authentically
  digital music editions, was to provide a proof of concept to demonstrate the potential
  of an innovative editorial technology and to deal with new issues associated with
  it. Six work packages jointly worked out by four project partners focused on the
  work’s graphic, logical, and acoustic (or performative) domains, emphasizing at
  the same time a comprehensive and detailed data contextualization and the formalized
  linkage concepts required for this. Using MEI, the music-encoding standard for a
  comprehensive work in Common Western Music Notation (CMN), for the first time and
  pairing it with a TEI encoding of the verbal text elements opened up completely
  new possibilities of processing, enriching, and reusing data. By exploring the opportunities
  for linking to and segmenting audio recordings, the project attempted to contribute
  to the solution of generic issues in the acoustic field; by demonstrating the potential
  of its innovative digital-edition model, it endeavored to promote discussion of
  future edition forms and to encourage further basic research through exemplary investigations
  of the variance aspect.
