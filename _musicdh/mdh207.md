blurb: "<i>Picardy Musical Heritage</i> is a website dedicated to the critical edition
  of music by composers from Picardy or who worked in this region – situated in the
  North of France – during the Renaissance. The site collects the critical editions
  of 268 pieces of music (259 available online), 41 references to manuscripts and
  printed sources produced from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century, and 8 biographies.
  Critical editions may be downloaded, free of charge, in three formats: pdf, Sibelius
  and MEI files. This is a project in progress, periodically enriched with new musical
  editions."
