blurb: |-
  <i>Corpus des luthistes</i> is a website dedicated to the Renaissance lute tablatures. The site collects the digital reproductions of three sixteenth-century tablatures by the Italian lutenists Francesco Spinacino and Vincenzo Capirola. Download free of charge the reproductions of the sources in pdf file, as well as the analytical descriptions of the sources.
  <br><br>The project was born in 2007, for the centenary of Spinacino’s first book tablature edition, as a digital development of the researches in this field by Jean-Michel Vaccaro, for the series Corpus des Luthistes Français (CNRS editions), and by many other visiting scholars of the Center for Renaissance Studies in Tours. This is a project in progress, periodically enriched with new digital reproductions and modern transcriptions of tablatures.
