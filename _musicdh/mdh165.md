blurb: 'Mozart''s piano sonata in B flat K. 333 with slurs and dynamics based on weather
  in your area. In Meteomozart, certain weather condition (e.g. sunny, cloudy, rainy,
  etc.) will change the score to show slurs and dynamics from one of the four sources.
  For example, Mozart’s autograph comes up in clear weather, while Bartók will show
  up in stormy weather. The main idea is to take away some control from the performer,
  or rather, to make it more obvious that some control is always taken away in a printed
  edition. This is done with good reason: editors typically build an understanding
  of the historical contingencies that make one version better than the other.'
