blurb: The Sounding Spirit digital library features songbooks and hymnals published
  across the southern United States from 1850 to 1925. Spanning holdings from four
  partner archives, the digital library includes words-only hymnals, gospel songbooks,
  spiritual collections, and shape-note tunebooks, demonstrating the wide variety
  of form, content, and presentation in southern vernacular sacred songbooks. Organized
  into collections that highlight textsâ€™ associated places, populations, genres, and
  denominational affiliations, the digital library allows for rich engagement with
  songbooks and hymnals seminal in their respective eras, but historically underrepresented
  in both archival holdings and scholarship.
