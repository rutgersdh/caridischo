blurb: Language in Lyrics seeks to index as many Gaelic songs known in Nova Scotia
  (Canada) as possible. About 6,000 songs have been indexed, including a rich set
  of metadata. Currently, the index exists as spreadsheets available online. However,
  this will move to a fully searchable database managed by the Digital Archive of
  Scottish Gaelic by April 2022.
