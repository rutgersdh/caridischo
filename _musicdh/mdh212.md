blurb: |-
  <i>The Workshop of Virtual Polyphonic Reconstructions</i> is a database dedicated to the reconstruction of missing parts in Renaissance polyphonic compositions.
  <br><br>The database gathers nearly 3,000 files concerning the remaining lacunar sources preserved in libraries in Europe and North America, as well as 400 transcribed lacunar pieces, 200 of which have been the subject of reconstruction. Users can consult the source records and the proposed reconstructions for the missing voice parts. This project is linked to the Lost Voices Project of Richard Freedman.
