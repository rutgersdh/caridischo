blurb: "<i>Decentering the Archive: Visual Fabrications of Sonic Momories</i> is a
  practice-based PhD project that records an artistic engagement with an archive DOMUS
  (Documentation Centre for Music) within the Music Library of Stellenbosch University.
  The creative outcomes include short films, sonic poems and sound recordings as well
  as a body of eggshell fragments recording the text components of the research. I
  curated these artworks in relation to the written research as a fully integrated
  dissertation of theory and practice on a digital platform - the online cultural
  journal project of Africa Open Institute: <a href='http://herri.org.za/' target='_blank'>herri.org.za</a>."
