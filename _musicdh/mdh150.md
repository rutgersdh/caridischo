blurb: IncipitSearch is a search engine for music-incipits. Incipts are a pragmatic
  approach for the cataloguing of notated music, in which a few bars of a score are
  transcribed. IncipitSearch is a service to interconnect musical pieces via metadata.
  It is also a tool that can be reintegrated into existing digital research platforms.
  By connecting some of the largest digital collections of music metadata it already
  offers access to around 1 million incipits.
