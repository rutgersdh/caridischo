blurb: In January 2019, a digital pilot entitled Connections in Sound focused on experimenting
  with audio collections of Irish traditional music. The principal aim was to investigate
  whether fieldwork audio and its attendant metadata could be linked between collections
  at the Library of Congress and across the Internet using proof-of-concept Uniform
  Resource Identifiers (URIs). Through an iterative approach, the team hypothesized
  that this activity would lead to valuable technical and humanistic insights about
  the status and possibilities for Irish traditional music as linked data. <a href='https://doi.org/10.21428/3e88f64f.30abd624'
