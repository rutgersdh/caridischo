blurb: "<i>Paisajes sonoros históricos</i> (c.1200-c.1800) is designed to explore
  historical urban soundscapes in Andalusian cities, aided by the outreach potential
  made possible through new technologies. This innovative approach will allow users
  to recreate music of the past in historical locations through the use of online
  interactive maps with digital resources (documents, videos, sounds, etc.). The contents
  aim to be inclusive and help achieve a better understanding of urban culture, establishing
  an aesthetic and intellectual dialogue with their sensorial aural history through
  an interdisciplinary approach that brings together urban musicology with areas including
  cultural history and art history, among others. Our main aim has been to create
  a digital platform to map the soundscapes of the cities of Granada and Seville as
  a paradigm that should prove adaptable to any urban centre over different historical
  periods. This platform is intended to be a useful and innovative tool for the educational
  institutions (from primary to tertiary education), museums, tourist boards, etc.
  of different cities."
