blurb: The SongData Project explores the potential of using discographic and biographic
  data to learn more about how popular music genres form, develop, and evolve over
  time. We are developing approaches for using information about songs and artists
  to explore the connections between musicians and the broader socio-cultural and
  institutional frameworks that govern genres.
