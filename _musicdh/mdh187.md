blurb: There has never been a simple way to search through the vast number of art
  songs by poet, date of composition, thematic links, keywords, or utility. SongHelix
  brings this ever-evolving information available into one searchable location. It
  is an online tool that enables users to search through the vast repertoire of art
  songs in order to find just the right piece. The websiteâ€™s immediate purpose is
  to give singers and teachers the primary online tool for finding related repertoire.
  A secondary, and broader purpose will be to help to revitalize the form of voice
  recital by allowing for creative programming through novel associations.
