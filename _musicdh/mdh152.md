blurb: |-
  AudibleRVA began in 2013 as a Digital Humanities project to study Richmond’s soundscape and music scene. Ongoing projects are organized along several themes: Live Music, Infrastructure, Education, Soundscapes, Noise, and Carceral Soundscapes.
  <br>
  The project’s core assumption is that a society’s ethical life is partly expressed through the allocation of sonic “goods,” including access to music making and listening and musical infrastructure (venues, schools, stores).
