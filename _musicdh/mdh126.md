blurb: This webpage houses resources for music by composers of color. It is not intended
  to be limited to (a) traditional music theory topics or (b) notated music in the
  Western art music tradition. Analytical notes are being made available, while a
  Google Sheet summarizes music theory topics that can be taught using the repertoire.
  <br><br>They welcome submissions of annotated scores and lesson plans that incorporate
  the music of composers of color. This site will be continually updated with more
  resources for music theory instructors.
