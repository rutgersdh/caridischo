blurb: A multisensory work of the past is explored through multimedia technologies
  of the present. Completed in 1510 for the parish of St. Lorenz in Nuremberg, this
  large-format gradual preserves the mass liturgy that was sung by choir boys until
  the Reformation was introduced in 1525. Provocative and satirical illuminations
  include the one from which the book takes its name. Many medieval manuscripts are
  too valuable and vulnerable to be handled. Digitally, however, these 2 volumes can
  now be touched by everyone.
