blurb: Welcome to ‘Soundscapes in the Early Modern World’, an AHRC-funded international
  research network that examines how sonic interaction shaped identities c. 1500-1800.
  It aims to develop new approaches to hearing the sounds of the early modern world,
  reflect on how we engage with historical soundscapes, and consider the multifaceted
  relationship between meaning and hearing. <br> <br> The network will extend understanding
  of the contexts and spaces in which sounds were heard. We are interested in how
  sounds shaped the lives of people and their communities, and also with the conceptual
  issues associated with studying past soundscapes.
