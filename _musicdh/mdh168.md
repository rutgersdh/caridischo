blurb: "<i>Chance of Weather</i> is a dynamic piano piece by composer Joseph L. Arkfeld
  (UMD). <i>Chance of Weather</i> is a modern take on a piano program piece that takes
  inspiration from weather conditions. Rather than focusing on a specific condition
  or setting, such as Debussy's <i>Jardins sous la pluie</i>, <i>Chance of Weather</i>
  engages with the weather that is currently affecting the performance environment.
  The piece is based on a dynamic digital score that follows pre-composed patterns
  depending on the weather at the location where it is being performed. The piece
  invites the outside world into the performance space, which is usually sterile to
  the elements. If the audience had to walk through a windy and rainy evening to get
  to a windowless, temperature controlled performance space, they will find that <i>Chance
  of Weather</i> evokes the gusts and the dampness of their day. Likewise, if they
  came on a pleasant warm afternoon, the piece will reflect their recent experience."
