blurb: jSymbolic is a software application intended for conducting research in the
  fields of music information retrieval (MIR), music theory and musicology. Its primary
  purpose is to extract statistical information from musical data stored symbolically
  in file formats such as MIDI or MEI. This statistical information is formulated
  as feature values, which may be fed directly into automatic classification systems,
  may be used to query large musical datasets, or may be used by musicologists and
  music theorists for conducting empirical musical research. jSymbolic is part of
  the jMIR music classification project hosted on SourceForge (jmir.sourceforge.net).
