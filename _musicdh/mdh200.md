blurb: Breitkopf & H채rtel founded a weekly newspaper called the <i>Allgemeine musikalische
  Zeitung</i> in October of 1798. About once per month, for the next forty years,
  readers also received a supplement called the <i>Intelligenz-blatt zur Allgemeine
  musikalische Zeitung</i>. A central feature of the <i>Intelligenz-blatt</i>, before
  its discontinuation in December of 1838, were the publication lists in which Breitkopf
  & H채rtel and other firms would advertise their latest music to potential customers.
  The 159 publication lists issued by Breitkopf & H채rtel itself provide a record of
  the musical editions (and occasional books and portraits) that the publisher printed
  during the early nineteenth century. This data set contains 6,405 advertisements
  for the music of approximately nine hundred composers and arrangers. Details gathered
  from the publication lists include the issue number, date of advertisement, name
  of composer or arranger, title of publication (often with key and instrumentation),
  and price as quoted in Saxon thalers and groschen. Entries are tagged to indicate
  repeated advertisements. The full name and dates of the credited musician (if known)
  are also provided.
