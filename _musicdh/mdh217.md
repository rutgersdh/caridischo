blurb: This collection highlights some of the rare and important hymnals in the Baylor
  hymnal collection. From the early printings of metrical Psalms following the Reformation
  to early gospel and Sunday School music, each hymnal included in the collection
  is an essential piece of congregational song history. You can also read more about
  the process we used at https://blogs.baylor.edu/baylorlibraries/2023/05/17/out-of-the-pew-backs-and-onto-the-web-digitizing-50-unique-hymnals-for-online-access/.
