blurb: Prosopography of Renaissance Singers is a database of biographies of professional
  singers who worked in the European chapels from 1350 to 1600. The database collects
  4557 entries and offers a wide variety of information, from the variant names of
  the singers to their dates and places of activities,  together with their complete
  and detailed biographies. This is a project in progress, periodically enriched with
  newly released biographies.
