  Explore the world collections of musical instruments
  Welcome to the world's largest freely accessible database for information on musical instruments held in public collections. Our database now contains the records of 64259 instruments. MIMO began life as a consortium of some of Europeâ€™s most important musical instruments museums, which came together for a European Commission funded project that aimed to create a single online access point to their collections. The MIMO Project ran from September 2009 until August 2011 and successfully achieved all of its objectives, in the process creating the world's largest freely accessible database for information on musical instruments held in public collections.
