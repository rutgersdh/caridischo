blurb: A long term edition project of the historically significant, sacred and secular
  monophonic repertories of the European Middle Ages with Latin texts. It chose MEI
  for digitizing their transcriptions in the preparation of both its print and digital
  editions. As standard notation software available on the market is not well suited
  for capturing transcriptions of neumatic notation, the project teamed up with the
  music typesetting firm Notengrafik Berlin to develop the specialized browser-based
  notation editor mono:di that operates directly on MEI data.
