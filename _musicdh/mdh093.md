blurb: The Westminster Choir College Archival Audio Collection includes commercial
  and locally-produced recordings spanning from approximately 1926 to the early 1980s.
  The collection includes many rare or unique recordings of a vast range of choral
  performances, rehearsals with renowned orchestras and conductors, faculty and student
  recitals, festivals, guest performers, lectures, convocations and commencements,
  and interviews with prominent figures in choral and church music. The collection
  will grow in scope as more recordings are digitized.
