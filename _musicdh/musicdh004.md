blurb: Documenting Teresa Carre単o brings together select primary source materials,
  such as advertisements, announcements, and reviews from newspapers, with descriptions
  or annotations in order to document Carre単o's career from 1862 - 1917. Access to
  criticism and reception of her performances, as well as other primary source documents,
  will be provided in original format when available or through transcription. A selection
  of Carre単o's tours are displayed both geographically on a map and temporally on
  a timeline, allowing users to explore primary sources or artifacts related to specific
  events.
