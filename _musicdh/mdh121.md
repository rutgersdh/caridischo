blurb: For centuries, the women of Dhrangadhra, a Jhala kingdom in western India,
  played a special role in singing stories of genealogy, life and death. Much (but
  not all) of this activity took place within the walls of the zenana, an all-women’s
  palace where many of Dhrangadhra’s most important oral traditions were upheld. This
  exhibit features the sounds of these women’s voices and their location in the zenana
  as well as some other parts of the palace, providing a glimpse into the wider Collection
  of Dhrangadhra Music found in the Archive of World Music of the Eda Kuhn Loeb Music
  Library.
