blurb: The RWA as a hybrid edition combines traditional volumes of printed editions
  and critical reports with corresponding digital publications. All of the sources
  (manuscripts, first prints, letters) as well as illustrating documents and a vast
  encyclopedic apparatus have been made available on DVD (till 2019) and are now re-
  and further published online at &quot;RWA online&quot; (www.reger-werkausgabe.de).
  Their reproduction, annotation, comparison and contextualisation offer all users
  who want to understand the work from its beginnings or to delve deeper into the
  compositional working process, numerous insights into Regerâ€™s working processes
  and into the works themselves.
