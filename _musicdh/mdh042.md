blurb: The RWA as a hybrid edition combines volumes of printed music with digital
  excerpts. All of the sources (manuscripts, first prints, letters) as well as illustrating
  documents are made available on DVD (online version is coming soon), scientifically
  processed by Edirom software. Their reproduction, annotation and comparison offer
  all users who want to understand the work from its beginnings or to delve deeper
  into the compositional working process, numerous insights into Regerâ€™s working processes
  and into the works themselves.
