blurb: 'Morales Mass Book is a companion site to the First Book of Masses by Cristóbal
  de Morales (ca. 1550-1553), a Spanish composer at the Papal chapel in Rome. Our
  site explores the Missarum liber primus (Lyon: Moderne, 1546) focusing on the composer,
  the printer, and the processes that informed the composition of four of Morales’s
  polyphonic masses. In addition, video and audio recordings invite us into the world
  of Morales’s superb music. The physical 1546 edition of the Missarum liber primus
  was acquired by the John J. Burns Library in 2011.'
