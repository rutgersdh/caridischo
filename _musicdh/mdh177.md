blurb: Every Noise at Once is an ongoing attempt at an algorithmically-generated,
  readability-adjusted scatter-plot of the musical genre-space, based on data tracked
  and analyzed for 5,701 genre-shaped distinctions by Spotify as of 2021-12-02. The
  calibration is fuzzy, but in general down is more organic, up is more mechanical
  and electric; left is denser and more atmospheric, right is spikier and bouncier.
