blurb: This project explores a little-studied repertory of sixteen sets of French
  polyphonic songs published in Paris by Nicolas Du Chemin between 1549 and 1568.
  Digital technologies are put to work in the service of these books in ways that
  will engender a broader discussion about style and structure in the sixteenth-century
  chanson.
