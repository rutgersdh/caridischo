blurb: |-
  In the last few years, the CERMAA (Center for Research on Music from Arabian and Akin countries) has developed a whole new trend in music analyses which were gathered under the VIAMAP, or the Video Animated Music Analysis Project.
  <br><br>
  Due to the rapid growth of the number of analyses, we decided to create this dedicated website to make it easier for musicologists and other interested people to browse throughout these.
  <br><br>
  All the VIAMAP analyses initially proposed in our main website at <a href='http://foredofico.org/CERMAA/' target='_blank'>http://foredofico.org/CERMAA/</a>, notably the Analyses page, are available on this site, including additionally the Byzantine chant scales analyses by Amine Beyhom. The site is continuously expanding, and new analyses added in their respective pages.
  <br><br>
  Video analyses are an alternative to Old Musicology analyses with scores, and allow for direct (graphical and literal) explanations while listening to the analyzed music.
