blurb: |-
  RTcmix is a real-time software &quot;language&quot; for doing digital sound synthesis and signal-processing. It is written in C/C++, and is distributed open-source, free of charge. In certain respects, it is similar in function to other extant unit-generator-based software languages such as CSOUND, SuperCollider and (to a lesser extent) JSyn and Max/MSP -- they do share a common heritage, after all. There are some differences, however, between all these languages... and variety is of course the spice of life! <br>
  So if you've been searching the web high and low for just the right library of DSP functions to include in your latest &amp; greatest &quot;killer&quot; (or maybe &quot;peacefully coexisting&quot;?) app, then RTcmix may just be the Right Package for You.
