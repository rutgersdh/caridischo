blurb: Sounding Tennyson presents sonic and textual versions of one of Tennyson’s
  most famous poems, &quot;Break, Break, Break.&quot; The Music section on our site
  shows images of musical scores (mostly by Tennyson’s wife, Emily) and gives the
  option to play the songs, with each measure marked in time with the music. Users
  can compare any one musical setting to other musical and textual drafts. The scores
  can be silently examined through the Music or Archives tab, which includes all the
  digitized items featured on Sounding Tennyson. An &quot;Earwitness&quot; section
  contains observers' accounts of listening to Tennyson or his family recite and the
  poet's response to hearing his poetry set to music. Following the Essays link brings
  up short articles, both highly specific to the poem and contextual.
