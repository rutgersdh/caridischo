blurb: Focusing on the career of Giovanni Legrenzi,<i>Musicians in Venice</i> hosts
  &quot;a bimodal network graph of the different musicians associated with the four
  sacred institutions where Legrenzi worked during his Venetian career. The network
  graph is also a text repository, as the node attributes include a full transcription
  of the documents that link individuals to institutions. These are mainly payment,
  hiring, and termination records.&quot;
