blurb: The Digital Archive of North Indian Classical Music was initiated in 2004 as
  part of the School of Cultural Texts and Records at Jadavpur University, Kolkata.
  The aim at inception was to create a collection of digitised recordings of North
  Indian classical music, and by 2007 a collection of about 1,000 hours was digitised,
  catalogued and made available. This new project will concentrate on performances
  of artists usually under-represented in large general collections.
