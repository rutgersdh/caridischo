blurb: Plainchant is a large collection of monophonic songs, which exist as one of
  the oldest notated music in the world. Combining information from the University
  of Western Ontario’s CANTUS database, one of the world’s foremost databases of metadata
  about plainchant, with our expertise as two of Canada’s leading scholars in optical
  music recognition and early music, we are developing a network and database infrastructure
  and software tools that will be able to automatically extract the musical and textual
  content from digitised plainchant manuscripts and to index that content in an internationally-accessible
  distributed database. This recognition system will free libraries from the prohibitive
  cost of expert human labour needed to transcribe these specialised manuscripts manually
  and will allow performers and coaches, such as those at the Gregorian Institute
  of Canada, to expand the repertoire and improve the historical fidelity of their
  recordings and performances.
