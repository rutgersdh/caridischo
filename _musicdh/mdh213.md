blurb: This site houses information about the vihuela de mano, or simply vihuela,
  the plucked musical instrument that flourished during the approximate period 1475-1625
  in Spain and throughout the Spanish empire, as well as other regions that had cultural
  links with Spain. In total, the vihuela was known and played in Spain, Portugal,
  ltaly and Latin America, as well other places from the Netherlands to Japan. This
  is a continuously growing database of all things pertaining to the vihuela that
  aims to be as comprehensive as possible. The three main fields of the database concern
  1) the vihuela itself, 2) vihuela music and 3) people who can be associated with
  the vihuela, especially players, composers, makers, and many others. The site integrates
  information concerning the sources of all this information, modern scholarship concerning
  the vihuela, and recordings of vihuela music.
