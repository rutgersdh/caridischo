blurb: The string quartet, for two violins, viola and violoncello, was one of the
  most widely-cultivated genres of chamber music during the Classical period, with
  the Viennese masters Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven all contributing substantially
  to the literature. The David M. Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Duke
  University has about forty collections of string quartets in parts dating from this
  time (about 1770-1840), most, though not all complete, and representing composers
  whose works are rarely found in modern editions. Digitization of these parts makes
  newly available for performance, study and recording a large and varied repertoire
  of works for this instrumental ensemble.
