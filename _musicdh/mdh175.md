blurb: 'This project was inspired by a deceptively simple question: what can maps
  tell us about music history? In scholarship and in the classroom, musicologists
  use maps to tell stories about the movement of music and musicians, as well as to
  contextualize music history within broader social, cultural, and political history.
  Inspired by pedagogical need, this project combines musicological methods with digital
  humanities theory and tools to produce maps that serve students, scholars, and the
  general public.'
