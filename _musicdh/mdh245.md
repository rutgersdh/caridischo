blurb: The Bernd Alois Zimmermann Complete Edition is the first comprehensive edition
  project for music after 1945 in the academy program and presents all of the composer's
  works, writings and a selection of correspondence in historical-critical hybrid
  editions. Interweaving works and multimedia piece concepts allow us to rethink the
  concept of the complete edition, to use the opportunities offered by digital music
  editions and to develop new philological methods. During the project period (2016–2040),
  the editions will be published as printed volumes by Schott Music and as digital
  editions as part of this online presence.
