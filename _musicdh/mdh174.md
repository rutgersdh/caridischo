blurb: Early Music Theory is dedicated to a variety of issues relating to the notation
  and intellectual context of music in the medieval and early modern period, as well
  as to the inter-relationships between these issues and musical performance and composition.
  The site at present includes works by and about fifteenth-century musician and lawyer
  Johannes Tinctoris (c. 1435-1511).
