blurb: "The Mixtape Museum (MXM) is an archive project established to collect, preserve,
  and share knowledge related to mixtape history. While the project covers all genres,
  it prioritizes Hip Hop research through the mixtape lens. \n<br>\nThe MXM is devoted
  to advancing public understanding and appreciation of the art, history, technique,
  and impact mixtapes have made around the world. While encouraging the research of
  mixtapes as records of time, place and situation, it will also examine the individuals
  that have shaped their existence."
