blurb: Josip Ipavec (1873-1921), the youngest of the composers that came from the
  famous Ipavec family of doctors and musicians, began composing music as a secondary
  school pupil. During his life, only five of his compositions were printed. With
  his pantomime Hampelmännchen, Josip Ipavec became known as the composer of the first
  Slovenian ballet. The other four compositions were published in the magazine Novi
  akordi. Other compositions of Josip Ipavec were initially left as manuscripts. Many
  of them were lost. This digital collection consists of the composer’s handwritten
  music, study notes, and the original libretto for his operetta, as well as many
  transcriptions of his compositions.
