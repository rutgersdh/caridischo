blurb: The Sarti Edition is a digital edition of two operas by the composer Giuseppe
  Sarti (1729–1802) who was famous throughout Europe during his lifetime. The edition
  was created as part of the third-party funded project <i>A Cosmopolitan Composer
  in Pre-Revolutionary Europe - Giuseppe Sarti</i> at the Universität der Künste,
  supported by the Einstein Foundation Berlin from 2013 to 2016. Two of Sarti's most
  successful Italian operas were edited, the Opera buffa <i>Fra i due litiganti il
  ​​terzo gode</i> (When two argue ...) and the Opera seria <i>Giulio Sabino</i>.
  The edition is a digital edition freely accessible via the Internet, which was created
  with the help of the tools of the Detmold Edirom project and the Music Encoding
  Initiative (MEI). The focus is on the presentation of selected different versions
  of each opera, which resulted from the processing of the works for new productions
  at other opera houses, as was common in the opera business of the late 18th century.
