blurb: The HISPAMUS proposal aims at enhancing the Hispanic music heritage from the
  15th to the 19th centuries, by exploiting the digital resources of these collections.
  In addition, thousands of oral tradition melodies that were compiled by folklorists
  in the 1950s decade are digitized just as images, currently without the possibility
  of content-based search or study. It is necessary to develop services and tools
  for the benefit of archives, libraries, scholars, computer scientists and general
  public. HISPAMUS tries to provide smart access to archival manuscripts of music
  scores, allowing its reuse and exploitation. In order to reach this ambitious goal,
  our group provides cutting-edge technology in the fields of Machine Learning, Pattern
  Recognition, and Optical Music Recognition.
