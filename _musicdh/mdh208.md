blurb: "<i>Renaissance Music in Croatia</i> is a website dedicated to the critical
  edition of music by composers and sources from the Croatian area, and also by Italian
  musicians who worked in Croatia during the Renaissance. This site collects the critical
  editions of 172 pieces of music, 36 references to musical and literary manuscripts
  and printed sources produced from the fifteenth to the end of the sixteenth century,
  and 13 biographies. The critical editions can be downloaded in three formats: pdf,
  Sibelius and MEI files. This is a project in progress, periodically enriched with
  new editions of music."
