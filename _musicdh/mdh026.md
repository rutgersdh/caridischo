blurb: The first ever thematic-bibliographic registration of all Nielsen’s compositions.
  It is based entirely on the so-called MEI Header (or metadata section) and was edited
  using the MerMEId tool. It includes all the information usually found in printed
  thematic catalogues such as instrumentation, date of composition, a short description
  of each work’s history, a list of movements including incipits, as well as lists
  of sources, performances, letters, diary entries and other documents.
