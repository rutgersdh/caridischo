blurb: The Scores of Scores lieder corpus encoding project is a major contribution
  to the OpenScore encoding effort. We are creating and releasing publicly a large
  repository of high-quality musical scores which any internet user will be able to
  play, download, transpose and use as they please. This Lieder sub-project concentrates
  on transcribing Public Domain works for voice and piano. Volunteer transcribers
  are based across Europe, Canada and the USA.
