blurb: |-
  NewDirections in Digital Jazz Studies uses state of the art music information retrieval and artificial intelligence algorithms for the analysis of jazz recordings and linked data to enable novel approaches to co-creative use of materials in the archival collections of the Institute of Jazz Studies and Scottish Jazz Archive.
  <br /> <br />
  This trans-Atlantic collaboration between jazz historians, technologists, and jazz archivists will expand access to unique materials held in archives and illuminate their musical relationships to more widely studied recordings. This project will create, analyse, and visualize relationships between audio and other materials and create rich research work knows to be shared within the scholarly community as a novel way to support co-creation with cultural institutions. We envision a disciplinary transformation through the discovery of new models for jazz historiography, and a broader, interdisciplinary transformation in methodology for digital humanities.q
