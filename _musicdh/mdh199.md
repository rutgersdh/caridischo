blurb: The mission of the Polyphony Project is to explore, preserve and present the
  living musical folklore of Ukrainian villages. In addition to recording the intangible
  cultural treasures of the Ukrainian peasantry using state-of-the-art technology,
  our priority is to make this heritage of unparalleled value accessible to contemporary
  society. Having accumulated over centuries, this legacy is finally available online
  in an organised form. We hope that our website will attract everyone from music
  enthusiasts to academic researchers.
