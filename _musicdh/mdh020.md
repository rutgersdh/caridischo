blurb: The Bonfils-Stanton Post-1945 Women Composers Index is an open-source searchable
  index created for the purpose of increasing the visibility, access, and serendipitous
  discovery of chamber works written after 1945 by women composers. Currently the
  index includes all post-1945 instrumental chamber works written by women composers
  housed in the Bonfils-Stanton Music Library. The index is being expanded to include
  vocal chamber works, and will ultimately be expanded to include works in collections
  other than the Bonfils-Stanton Music Library.
