blurb: This project is intended for both scholars and musicians. It is based on the
  sixteen sets of partbooks of chansons published by the Parisian house of Nicolas
  Du Chemin between 1549 and 1568. Facsimiles are viewable on the website and PDFs
  of the images can be downloaded. Transcriptions of full scores are also available.
  Underlying encoded data facilitates analyses. Freedman's companion site, <a href='http://digitalduchemin.org/reconstructions/?page=3'
  target='_blank'>Lost Voices</a>, offers PDF transcriptions of incomplete works indicating
  which parts survive and which do not.
