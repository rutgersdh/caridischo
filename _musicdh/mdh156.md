blurb: "<i>Gulu SoundTracks</i> curates a collection of eight audio tracks as a digital
  ethnographic sound project. The collection invites listeners into the sonic habitus
  and imaginations of their creators, based in the city of Gulu, Uganda. Individually,
  these tracks each tell stories about daily life in Gulu. Together, the compilation
  is not a complete story so much as a series of stories inspired by histories of
  listening to a place and recording its sounds. These are narratives evoked musically–
  without lyrics– through the aesthetic manipulations of densely-layered audio samples,
  software instrumental sounds, and grooves."
