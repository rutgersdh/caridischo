blurb: |-
  Prague Concert Life 1850-1881: an annotated database is a unique online research resource channeling first-hand accounts of Prague music and culture over the years 1850-1881 into a remarkably wide-ranging and comprehensive scholarly survey.

  Through fully searchable records of both public and private, social and cultural events involving music performance – from inns and cafés to concert halls, salons, theatres and pleasure gardens – excepting only productions of opera, the resource explores the city’s entire musical landscape.
