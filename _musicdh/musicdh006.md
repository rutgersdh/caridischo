blurb: The New York Philharmonic played its first concert on December 7, 1842. Since
  then, it has merged with the New York Symphony, the New/National Symphony, and had
  a long-running summer season at New York's Lewisohn Stadium. This Performance History
  database documents all known concerts of all of these organizations, amounting to
  more than 20,000 performances. The New York Philharmonic Leon Levy Digital Archives
  provides an additional interface for searching printed programs alongside other
  digitized items such as marked music scores, marked orchestral parts, business records,
  and photos.
