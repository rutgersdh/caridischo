blurb: The Songs From Testimonies project collects and records songs and poems discovered
  in our testimonies. Our musician-in-residence, Zisl Slepovitch, took the songs,
  conducted research about their origins, then arranged and recorded versions with
  his ensemble, featuring Sasha Lurje. The songs and poems you are about to hear were
  sung or recounted in a number of testimonies and reflect the richness of these documents.
  They are songs from the interwar period and from the ghettos, and the camps. Originally,
  these songs were sung individually and collectively, but in survivorsâ€™ testimonies
  they are recounted or performed by individuals. They thus remind us that the survivor
  singing them represents all those who did not survive to sing again, and remind
  us of the absence of the original audience.
