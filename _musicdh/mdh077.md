blurb: CRIM is a collaborative project about similarity in music, with human annotated
  scores, databases of related pieces, and (soon in public) an entire suite of Python/Pandas
  analytic tools that find melodic/rhythmic/contrapuntal patterns in just about any
  encoded symbolic music score. These tools will be incorporated into CRIM.
