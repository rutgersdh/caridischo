blurb: In the process of confronting the enormity of Metastasio research, a considerable
  amount of disparate information has been drawn together. Yet even as this information
  serves the Metastasio projects for which it was initially gathered, its frequent
  usage has suggested that it be made available to the scholarly community at large
  in as accessible a form as is possible. This decision has lead to the creation of
  both a Website Handbook for Metastasio Research and a Metastasio Database. More
  information continues to be gathered and will be added to the appropriate areas
  in due course. Particularly important for the present, however, is the practical
  aspect of both the Handbook and the Database. For the information that is already
  online, Dr. Don Neville, the site director, will be pleased to make additions and
  deletions or correct any errors that users may be kind enough to bring to his attention.
