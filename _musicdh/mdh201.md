blurb: "Since 1996, Leo Smit Stichting has brought music by suppressed composers to
  life. Sometimes music is heard for the first time, sometimes it resounds after 75
  years. We would like to share what we’ve discovered with a wider audience. Every
  musician can write history with music of unheard-of beauty, awaiting performance.
  Music that deserves an audience. Every programmer can choose untrodden paths and
  suprise their audience. Every listener should have access to the most beautiful
  music, without censoring. Join us in discovering forbidden music. \n<br><br>\nOur
  English language website Forbidden Music Regained offers access to more than 2,000
  compositions of suppressed composers. We invite you to browse the database by visiting
  the works list at the bottom of each composer’s biography. Click a title and discover
  where you may find the sheetmusic. If we know of a recording, you will find it here.
  You may even find a direct link to listen online. \n<br><br>However, a more specific
  search is also possible: for instance by selecting a genre (vocal music, chamber
  music, orchestral music), selecting specific instrumentations (string quartet, piano
  solo, choir, flute and piano and much more) or filtering the year in which a work
  was composed. You may want to filter published works (or works that have never been
  published) or narrow your search down to composers of your choice. From the results
  list, it is immediately clear which works can be heard online.\n<br><br>\nAlmost
  all manuscripts have been scanned, and can be ordered via Donemus webshop."
