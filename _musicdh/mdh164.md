blurb: An eighteen-month pilot study for the OCVE project was supported by the Andrew
  W. Mellon Foundation in 2003–04, followed by three developmental phases (2005–09,
  2011–15, and 2015–17). The OCVE site currently comprises c. 6,000 digital images
  of individual pages of primary source material of the music of Fryderyk Chopin,
  comprising music text and other elements of manuscripts, first editions, and later
  impressions produced during Chopin’s lifetime or after his death, along with associated
  metadata. The latter includes excerpts from Christophe Grabowski and John Rink’s
  <i>Annotated Catalogue of Chopin’s First Editions</i> (Cambridge University Press,
  2010), which itself is available in digitised form in the Chopin Online resource.
  So too is a restructured and redesigned version of <a href='http://www.chopinonline.ac.uk/cfeo/'
  target='_blank'>Chopin’s First Editions Online</a> (CFEO). Together these three
  sites constitute a resource of unprecedented breadth and depth, providing new access
  to the most important sources, fostering new understanding of their individual and
  collective significance, and facilitating scholarly research and performance alike.
