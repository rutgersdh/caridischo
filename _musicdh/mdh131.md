blurb: |-
  DIAMM (Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music) is a leading resource for the study of medieval manuscripts. We present images and metadata for thousands of manuscripts on this website. We also provide a home for scholarly resources and editions, undertake digital restoration of damaged manuscripts and documents, publish high-quality facsimiles, and offer our expertise as consultants. DIAMM is a primarily Musicological resource, though we have photographed early documents for other projects such as the Anglo-Saxon Charters project at Cambridge University (Prof Simon Keynes) and Alison Stones' Arthurian MSS project at the University of Pittsburgh. The remit of the project is to photograph and archive images of:
  all fragments of English polyphonic music written before 1550; all complete sources of English polyphonic music before 1500, and as many as practically possible 1500-1550; all fragments of European polyphony 1300-1450; as many complete manuscripts of European polphony 1300-1450, and beyond as is possible and practicable.
