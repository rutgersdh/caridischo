blurb: These digitised volumes contain approximately 10,000 musical compositions,
  which have been individually indexed. The volumes mainly consist of partbooks of
  vocal polyphony, but also include some early printed tablatures for keyboard or
  plucked string instruments. They include music printed in Italy, Germany, France
  and England. Early Music Online was funded by JISCâ€™s 2011 Rapid Digitisation Programme.
