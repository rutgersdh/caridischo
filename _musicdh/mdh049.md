blurb: The purpose of this project was to investigate the potential offered by computational
  approaches for stylistic characterisation of performances. Chopin's mazurkas were
  chosen as a varied but well defined repertory that poses interesting performance
  practice issues and has been frequently recorded; we collected recordings of about
  3000 individual mazurka performances, although only a modest proportion was analysed
  within this project.
