blurb: "<i>Furnace and Fugue</i> brings to life in digital form an enigmatic seventeenth-century
  text, Michael Maier’s alchemical emblem book <i>Atalanta fugiens</i>. This intriguing
  and complex text from 1618 reinterprets Ovid’s legend of Atalanta as an alchemical
  allegory in a series of fifty emblems, each of which contains text, image, and a
  musical score for three voices. Re-rendering Maier’s multimedia masterpiece as an
  enhanced digital publication, <i>Furnace and Fugue</i> allows contemporary readers
  to hear, see, manipulate, and investigate <i>Atalanta fugiens</i> in ways that were
  perhaps imagined when it was composed but were simply impossible to realize in full
  before now."
