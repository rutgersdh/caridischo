blurb: The catalogue was created as part of the wider project Delius, Modernism, and
  the Sound of Place. This project pursued a new and comprehensive evaluation of Delius,
  testing the veracity of constructions of the composer as a nationalist and rhapsodic
  musical portraitist, investigating his compositional methods, and situating him
  within both different geographical contexts and the complex cultural phenomenon
  of modernism. Consequently, it was the aim of the catalogue to produce a resource
  that facilitated this investigation, that provided thorough and up-to-date information
  on the state of sources for a given work, its process of composition, editing, and
  revision, its performance history and its relationship to other works.
