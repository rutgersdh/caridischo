Yet even as this information serves the Metastasio projects for which it was initially gathered, its frequent usage has suggested that it be made available to the scholarly community at large in as accessible a form as is possible. This decision has lead to the creation of both a Website Handbook for Metastasio Research and a Metastasio Database. More information continues to be gathered and will be added to the appropriate areas in due course. Particularly important for the present, however, is the practical aspect of both the Handbook and the Database.

Significant insights are anticipated for evaluating the entire compositional history and aesthetics of the 19th and 20th century crucially founded on Beethoven. The project is organized in a set of five modules, each concentrating on different aspects of compositional processes, musical variance, and reorganization of musical material found in Beethoven’s works. Each module builds on its predecessors, with the last showing the full potential of digital editions by combining a traditional edition of the work, a source edition and a genetic edition of the work’s text.

The JRP also provides analytical tools that can be used to gain insight into individual works, the style of a given composer, or the musical lingua franca.
