The analysis procedure (which is based on the traditional McAulay-Quatieri technique) attempts to represent a sound with many individual sinusoidal tracks (partials), each corresponding to a single sinusoidal wave with time varying frequency and amplitude.
<br>
Something which closely resembles the original input sound (a resynthesis) can be generated by computing and adding all of the individual time varying sinusoidal waves together. In almost all cases the resynthesis will not be exactly identical to the original sound (although it is possible to get very close).
<br>
Aside from offering a very detailed analysis of the time varying frequency content of a sound, a sinusoidal model offers a great deal of flexibility for editing and manipulation. SPEAR supports flexible selection and immediate manipulation of analysis data, cut and paste, and unlimited undo/redo. Hundreds of simultaneous partials can be synthesized in real-time and documents may contain thousands of individual partials dispersed in time.

Controlling the repertory can be time-consuming and problematic: assembling the material to examine even a single family of refrains can involve the identification, location and manipulation of large amounts of material.
<br> <br>
Since the middle of the nineteenth century, scholars of French literature have been identifying refrains in the single text on which they were working, but it was not until 1964 that Friedrich Gennrich published the first attempt at a catalogue, an experiment that was amplified in 1969 by Nico H. J. van den Boogaard. Both these works were catalogues, and van den Boogaard’s was also an edition of the texts of the refrains. Music was not mentioned in the catalogue and not edited. Both these shortcomings were rectified in Anne Ibos-Augé's dissertation, ‘La fonction des insertions lyriques dans des œuvres narratives et didactiques aux xiiième et xivème siècles’. 
<br> <br> REFRAIN seeks to integrate these pre-existing work on the refrain into a single, searchable, database and to bring the data up to date.

It is designed and developed by Joanna Swafford with the generous support of a Scholars' Lab Fellowship from the University of Virginia. It contains four songs: Michael William Balfe's &quot;Come into the Garden, Maud&quot; and Sir Arthur Somervell's &quot;Come into the Garden, Maud&quot; (both based on Alfred Lord Tennyson's monodrama, <i>Maud</i>), Sir Arthur Sullivan's version of Adelaide Procter's &quot;A Lost Chord,&quot; and Caroline Norton's &quot;Juanita.&quot;

Parlor and art song settings of Victorian poems are not mere examples of Victorian kitsch: rather, these settings function as readings of the poems they use as lyrics. Songs of the Victorians includes parlor songs alongside art songs to challenge the conventional musicological assumption that popular, domestic music naïvely misrepresents its poetic source material. Many parlor songs actually perform nuanced understandings of the texts they set and address subjects such as the silencing of women, the difficulty of resolving gender inequalities, religious questionings, and &quot;cross-singing,&quot; or women singing text written for a male character.
