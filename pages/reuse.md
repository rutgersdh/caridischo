### Leaguesourcing

All of our entries were compiled during one of the out-of-synch events that defined [The Caribbean Digital VII](http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/2020/directory/) conference. We shared a "[Data Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PfgI0GrQR60gwRFVIZmZtWae9JyAMpZNFOZRe5xsMsg/edit#gid=0)" on Google docs with our colleagues on social media and on our site. Soon after many joined us adding their own projects or the projects they knew about. Since we know most---if not all---of the contributors to the sheet, perhaps it's more appropriate to call our method of data-gathering leaguesourcing.

We are certainly not the first to compile a similar list. Here are some other useful attempts, that in turn served as sources for CariDiScho2020:

- "[Black Digital Humanities Projects & Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZwucjyAAR7QiEZl238_hhRPXo5-UKXt2_KCrwPZkiQ/edit#heading=h.lfar8xoosxqv)" by [Colored Conventions](https://twitter.com/CCP_org)
- This [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/jmjafrx/status/1285202367605022720) by Jessica Marie Johnson
- This crowdsourced "[List of DH Projects/Resources in Women’s and Gender History](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u-5vO2oQDUcqcBkvK9BUlzOPYxIPFZxXgC1quUZv37c/edit)" curated by [Shelley Rose](https://twitter.com/shelleyerose)
- This crowdsourced list of "[Latin American, Caribbean, \[and Latinx\] Digital Humanities Projects & Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE5s77JETxUC6Qx_ZOd7aiRxfr2WBPNDweTemJGcYT8/edit#heading=h.epa9pw1nzaoj)"
- This fantastic spreadsheet: "[Caribbean Digital : Media + Arts + Culture Projects](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_v7LmyvN7Xwgev0Fqhs22gzUxraB5sZoZ9amF8G2cxE/edit#gid=0)""
- "[Jamaica: Online sources for research in arts, history, and culture](https://crln.acrl.org/index.php/crlnews/article/view/9496/10780)"
- [DLOC Search Results for Digital Humanities](https://dloc.com/results/?t=digital%20humanities)
- "[Indotel Bibliotecas Virtuales](http://cti.indotel.gob.do/bibliotecas-virtuales/)"
- and the [LACLI](https://salalm.org/lane/lacli/) directory.


Ten days before the event, Soraya Limare and Alex Gil started curating, adding to and refining the data that was available. Akin to a census, this directory therefore is a snapshot of our record up to the end of 2020---the last week of November, 2020, to be precise. 

### Reuse the Data

After the spreadsheet was more or less in good condition it was [ported to Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/). Wax is inspired by [FAIR data principles](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/13427), and as such strives to make its collections findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. One of its neat features, is that it allows you to share the data quite easily.
