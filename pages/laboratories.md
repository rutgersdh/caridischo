Like many others working in the DH directory space, we have found that some projects do not lend themselves to easy classification. Although all of our our music digital humanities genre tagging is subject to interrogation, these entries are particularly elusive. They may borrow elements of DH or music scholarship genres---i.e., edition, software, visualization---and remix them into a work that defies labeling. A work like the _CHARM Mazurka Project_ includes a discography, plots of performance tempos and comparisons, and the Sonic Visualiser software. _Phantom Islands -- A Sonic Atlas_ provides us with a map interface through which to explore artifacts of the age of colonial expansion accompanied by "musical, biophonic and geophonic soundscapes" by composer Andrew Pekler. These entries are arguably the projects that gesture the most towards a uniquely born-digital music DH. A category of work that may acquire a recognizable name in the future, but for now is bubbling merrily away in laboratory test tubes, hence our title. Whether they are first-of-their-kind, "genrequeer," or *sui generis*, we've included these projects in Laboratories.
