### What counts as music DH? 

At the MLA 2018 Annual Meeting, there was some discussion about what constitutes a digital humanities project in music. Here follow some brief remarks and loose guidelines. In comments to the meeting minutes, Michael Cuthbert remarked that one often observes a distinction between composition (digital art) and musicology and music theory (digital humanities). David Day asked what distinctions we might draw between an online digital collection or library (e.g. the Danish National Digital Sheet Music Archive), a source of structured or semi-structured data (e.g. a music encoding dataset), and a project that includes some editorial apparatus, critical essays and/or similar contribution (e.g. the CHARM Mazurka Project or the Josquin Research Project). To this, one might add bibliographic and information resources, e.g. Early Music Sources and Digital Resources for Musicology. And music teachers use a range of digital technologies as well, although the list maintainer is less well acquainted with online presentations of materials in music pedagogy. In our [data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UyCED16mYxo3XE4RuushxE7DWyqR_CNFecn0k79ldA4/edit?usp=sharing), we have leaned towards specialized digital collections, digital editions, and other projects that hover over the general area of bibliographic and musicological studies. The emphasis is there for now, but there's no reason why we would not also include strong contributions in digital music pedagogy, theory, composition, as well as well-prepared/described datasets. To that end, please make use of the `claimed_category` field to describe your contribution. We have used that field to tease out some genre groupings and to think about other ways of presenting this information.

### Simple answer, please?

What about this? The digital resources we use and produce to do our research. And the new forms our research, teaching, and publishing activities can take because of computers. And music. There should be a relationship to music.

### Why can't I easily search by my field of study? 

While the original data sheet from 2018 asks for "Academic Field / Areas," we have decided to suppress that column for a few reasons. First, we wanted this directory to be relatively simple to maintain, and we didn't want to overload our contributors or our users with lots of metadata. Second, while there *are* separate professional societies for ethnomusicology, historical musicology, music theory, music librarianship, music information retrieval, and so on, we notice that these distinctions are getting fuzzier, perhaps especially so in born-digital works. We'd like to plant a flag on the soil of interdisciplinarity rather than recreate disciplinary divides. To that end, unless disciplinary keywords show up in a blurb, adherence to any given subfield won't be so obvious. 

### Why is my project not here?

This directory was compiled over a period of a few years by a [group of our colleagues]({{ '/credits/' | absolute_url}})---librarians and scholars. We issued a [call for collaboration]({{ '/cfc/' | absolute_url}}) on social media networks to promote our data collection. To be sure, we've got our biases, but we've done our best to get the word out. In short, we don't know why your project isn't here. 

### So... how do I add my project?

The website for this directory was built as a static site by choice. It is meant to be a snapshot in time, not an ever-evolving platform. We are keeping [our original Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UyCED16mYxo3XE4RuushxE7DWyqR_CNFecn0k79ldA4/edit?usp=sharing) open and available to everyone. Please add your project there! There's a column for the year a new entry was added. Make sure to use that. At future meetings of the Music Library Association, we may decide to build a new directory.
