### What counts as music DH? 

At the MLA 2018 Annual Meeting, there was some discussion about what constitutes a digital humanities project in music. Here follow some brief remarks and loose guidelines. In comments to the meeting minutes, Michael Cuthbert remarked that one often observes a distinction between composition (digital art) and musicology and music theory (digital humanities). David Day asked what distinctions we might draw between an online digital collection or library (e.g. the Danish National Digital Sheet Music Archive), a source of structured or semi-structured data (e.g. a music encoding dataset), and a project that includes some editorial apparatus, critical essays and/or similar contribution (e.g. the CHARM Mazurka Project or the Josquin Research Project). To this, one might add bibliographic and information resources, e.g. Early Music Sources and Digital Resources for Musicology. And music teachers use a range of digital technologies as well, although the list maintainer is less well acquainted with online presentations of materials in music pedagogy. In our [data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UyCED16mYxo3XE4RuushxE7DWyqR_CNFecn0k79ldA4/edit?usp=sharing), we have leaned towards specialized digital collections, digital editions, and other projects that hover over the general area of bibliographic and musicological studies. The emphasis is there for now, but there's no reason why we would not also include strong contributions in digital music pedagogy, theory, composition, as well as well-prepared/described datasets. To that end, please make use of the `category` field to describe your contribution. We have used that field to tease out some genre groupings and think about other ways of presenting this information.

### Why is my project not here?

This directory was compiled over a period of a few years by a [group of our colleagues]({{ '/credits/' | absolute_url}})---librarians and scholars. We did our best to collect data by searching relevant professional listservs, conference hashtags on social media, [Reviews in DH](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/), [DH Awards](http://dhawards.org/), and other sources. 

### So... how do I add my project?

The website for this directory was built as a static site by design. It is meant to be a snapshot in time, not an ever-evolving platform. We are keeping [our original Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UyCED16mYxo3XE4RuushxE7DWyqR_CNFecn0k79ldA4/edit?usp=sharing) open and available to everyone. Please add your project there! There's a column for the year a new entry was added. Make sure to use that. At future meetings of the Music Library Association, we may decide to build a new directory.
