The [Digital Humanities Interest Group](https://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/members/group.aspx?id=119828) of the Music Library Association invites you to help curate an online bibliography of specialized digital resources and born-digital scholarship in music. This project will engage the community in compiling entries in an open, shared online [data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UyCED16mYxo3XE4RuushxE7DWyqR_CNFecn0k79ldA4/edit?usp=sharing). First begun during the Music Library Association's Annual Meeting in Portland in 2018, we are seeking to expand the bibliography with contributions from the past three years in the fields of (digital) music archives and librarianship, musicology and ethnomusicology, and music theory. The dataset will be used to produce an [online directory](https://rutgersdh.github.io/musicdh/) that provides browse, preview, and search functionality, allowing users to enter the comprehensive bibliography through a variety of pathways. 

### How it works

This will be an online, asynchronous effort, held on **Tuesday, October 12, 2021**, throughout the day. The following Wednesday, October 13, may be reserved for  wrap-up activities. You can of course enter your project(s) on the data sheet at any time before or after those dates. Although before is better to be included in this year's online directory.

You can get help and ask questions of our project moderators on the Music Library Association Slack, Twitter, or via email. [Reserve](https://forms.gle/EbfeFo1C4Tez7aSE9) to receive a Slack invitation and additional event details!
