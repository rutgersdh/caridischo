### The Site

Credit for the site build is owed to Alex Gil, whose work Francesca Giannetti ~~stole~~ copied! for the present version. 

The site architecture is built using Wax, a minimal computing ([minicomp](https://github.com/minicomp)) project led by [Marii Nyr√∂p](http://marii.info/). Wax relies on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [IIIF](http://iiif.io), [Leaflet IIIF](https://github.com/mejackreed/Leaflet-IIIF), [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/), and [IIIF_S3](https://github.com/cmoa/iiif_s3), and builds upon work by [Peter Binkley](https://github.com/pbinkley), [David Newbury](https://github.com/workergnome), and [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex).
