Once entries were collected, a core team comprised of Maristella Feustle, Bonnie Finn, Francesca Giannetti, Anna Kijas, Kerry Masteller, and Stephanie Sussmeier put in some extra hours to clean the data, add missing data, and provide screenshots. 

### The Site

Credit for the site build is owed to Alex Gil, whose work Francesca Giannetti modified for the present version. 

The site architecture is built using Wax, a minimal computing ([minicomp](https://github.com/minicomp)) project led by [Marii Nyröp](http://marii.info/). Wax relies on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [IIIF](http://iiif.io), [Leaflet IIIF](https://github.com/mejackreed/Leaflet-IIIF), [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/), and [IIIF_S3](https://github.com/cmoa/iiif_s3), and builds upon work by [Peter Binkley](https://github.com/pbinkley), [David Newbury](https://github.com/workergnome), and [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex).

### Partners

This inventory emerges from the meeting of the Digital Humanities Interest Group (DHIG) of the [Music Library Association](https://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/) at the 2018 annual meeting in Portland, Oregon. The current convener of the MLA-DHIG and maintainer of this directory is Francesca Giannetti, Digital Humanities Librarian at Rutgers--New Brunswick. Her work on this project was facilitated by a fall 2021 research leave.
