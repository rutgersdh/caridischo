blurb: Funded by the Collections as Data program with support from the Mellon Foundation,
  this project will enhance access to existing Caribbean newspaper digital collections
  by making texts available for bulk download to its users. This will facilitate modes
  of scholarship that depend on access to image and textual data at scale and will
  enable a new level of access to titles not included in newspaper data resources
  such as Chronicling America. To meet the needs of the dLOC community for teaching
  and research, we will demonstrate the potential of newspaper data by creating a
  pilot thematic tool kit focused on hurricanes and tropical cyclones.
