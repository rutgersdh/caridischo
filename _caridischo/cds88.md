blurb: Developed by historian Laurent Dubois, PhD candidate in English Mary Caton
  Lingold, and composer-scholar David Garner, Musical Passage uses a digital format
  to explore a unique artifact of early African diasporic music. The site is designed
  around two pages from eighteenth-century British naturalist and collector Hans Sloane’s
  A Voyage to the Islands (1707), which documents his time in Jamaica in the late
  1680s. The pages of Voyage that have been placed at the center of this site present
  notation of songs played at a “festival.” This material is precious and fascinating,
  representing the earliest notation we have of music produced by enslaved Africans
  in the Caribbean or North America. The performers whose music is represented and
  interpreted here were likely survivors of the Middle Passage who may have been playing
  music they had learned in their homelands. They may also have been in the process
  of creating entirely new performance traditions.
