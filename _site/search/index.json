    "blurb": "The project aims to combine two of the most current research areas in music philology – the exploration of the genesis of musical works incorporated in texts of varying completeness. The projected multi-perspective focus becomes a central musicological research topic for gaining a differentiated picture of the text-in-progress, making it visible and reflecting it critically. Significant insights are anticipated for evaluating the entire compositional history and aesthetics of the 19th and 20th century crucially founded on Beethoven. The project is organized in a set of five modules, each concentrating on different aspects of compositional processes, musical variance, and reorganization of musical material found in Beethoven’s works. Each module builds on its predecessors, with the last showing the full potential of digital editions by combining a traditional edition of the work, a source edition and a genetic edition of the work’s text. These editions will all be prepared and edited using the Edirom tools, whereas on the data layer, everything will be encoded in MEI. The project aims to trace the textual development very closely, so that information beyond the current level of detail provided by MEI is required.",

This recognition system will free libraries from the prohibitive cost of expert human labour needed to transcribe these specialised manuscripts manually and will allow performers and coaches, such as those at the Gregorian Institute of Canada, to expand the repertoire and improve the historical fidelity of their recordings and performances.",

Chopin's mazurkas were chosen as a varied but well defined repertory that poses interesting performance practice issues and has been frequently recorded; we collected recordings of about 3000 individual mazurka performances, although only a modest proportion was analysed within this project.",

Today we take for granted such inventions as the automobile, airplane, radio, and telephone; they have become part of our daily lives. However, the initial appearance of these and other inventions created a myriad of responses in American society ranging from excitement and delight to anxiety and scorn. This collection reflects those varied reactions through the medium of popular music publications.",

Consequently, it was the aim of the catalogue to produce a resource that facilitated this investigation, that provided thorough and up-to-date information on the state of sources for a given work, its process of composition, editing, and revision, its performance history and its relationship to other works.",
