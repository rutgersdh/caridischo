In almost all cases the resynthesis will not be exactly identical to the original sound (although it is possible to get very close).\n<br>\nAside from offering a very detailed analysis of the time varying frequency content of a sound, a sinusoidal model offers a great deal of flexibility for editing and manipulation. SPEAR supports flexible selection and immediate manipulation of analysis data, cut and paste, and unlimited undo/redo. Hundreds of simultaneous partials can be synthesized in real-time and documents may contain thousands of individual partials dispersed in time.

Making the St. Petersburg scores available, as well as the publications of the successor publishers, Juwal and Jibneh with offices in Berlin and Tel Aviv, not only provides important documentation of the work of Jewish composers during the early twentieth century, but will also provide access to these works for interested performers and scholars worldwide.",

SGYF is a platform for citizenship. We hope this archive will be useful in disrupting the kinds of stories normally told about refugees.

The piece invites the outside world into the performance space, which is usually sterile to the elements.

Completed in 1510 for the parish of St. Lorenz in Nuremberg, this large-format gradual preserves the mass liturgy that was sung by choir boys until the Reformation was introduced in 1525. Provocative and satirical illuminations include the one from which the book takes its name. Many medieval manuscripts are too valuable and vulnerable to be handled. Digitally, however, these 2 volumes can now be touched by everyone.",

    "blurb": "The long thirteenth century was characterised by a vernacular musico-poetic culture in which short fragments of text and/or music circulated within and between songs of various types (chanson à refrain, chanson avec des refrains, rondeau), the motet repertory, the romance and a host of other types that impinged on music, literature or both. Controlling the repertory can be time-consuming and problematic: assembling the material to examine even a single family of refrains can involve the identification, location and manipulation of large amounts of material.\n<br> <br>\nSince the middle of the nineteenth century, scholars of French literature have been identifying refrains in the single text on which they were working, but it was not until 1964 that Friedrich Gennrich published the first attempt at a catalogue, an experiment that was amplified in 1969 by Nico H. J. van den Boogaard. Both these works were catalogues, and van den Boogaard’s was also an edition of the texts of the refrains. Music was not mentioned in the catalogue and not edited. Both these shortcomings were rectified in Anne Ibos-Augé's dissertation, ‘La fonction des insertions lyriques dans des œuvres narratives et didactiques aux xiiième et xivème siècles’. \n<br> <br> REFRAIN seeks to integrate these pre-existing work on the refrain into a single, searchable, database and to bring the data up to date. It indexes not only the location of the refrain in its song, motet, romance or other context but delivers the exact manuscript reading for every occurrence of every refrain in every manuscript source.",

Songs of the Victorians includes parlor songs alongside art songs to challenge the conventional musicological assumption that popular, domestic music naïvely misrepresents its poetic source material. Many parlor songs actually perform nuanced understandings of the texts they set and address subjects such as the silencing of women, the difficulty of resolving gender inequalities, religious questionings, and &quot;cross-singing,&quot; or women singing text written for a male character. These socially acceptable, sentimental songs often enabled women to address transgressive topics that otherwise would have been forbidden.",

In addition to the bibliographical information, it includes preliminary and concluding textual material of the documents (i.e., title pages, dedications, laudatory poems, advice to users, imprimatur, indices, and colophons).
