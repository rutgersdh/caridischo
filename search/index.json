The project is organized in a set of five modules, each concentrating on different aspects of compositional processes, musical variance, and reorganization of musical material found in Beethoven’s works. Each module builds on its predecessors, with the last showing the full potential of digital editions by combining a traditional edition of the work, a source edition and a genetic edition of the work’s text. These editions will all be prepared and edited using the Edirom tools, whereas on the data layer, everything will be encoded in MEI.

The YCAC makes available metadata for each MIDI file, as well as a list of pitch simultaneities (&quot;salami slices&quot;) in the MIDI file. Metadata include the piece's composer, the composer's country of origin, date of composition, genre (e.g., symphony, piano sonata, nocturne, etc.), instrumentation, meter, and key. The processing step groups the file's pitches into vertical slices each time a pitch is added or subtracted from the texture, recording the slice's offset (measured in the number of quarter notes separating the event from the file's beginning), highest pitch, lowest pitch, prime form, scale-degrees in relation to the global key (as determined by experts), and local key information (as determined by a windowed key-profile analysis). The corpus contains 13,769 MIDI files by 571 composers yielding over 14,051,144 vertical slices.",

The other four compositions were published in the magazine Novi akordi. Other compositions of Josip Ipavec were initially left as manuscripts. Many of them were lost.

In almost all cases the resynthesis will not be exactly identical to the original sound (although it is possible to get very close).\n<br>\nAside from offering a very detailed analysis of the time varying frequency content of a sound, a sinusoidal model offers a great deal of flexibility for editing and manipulation. SPEAR supports flexible selection and immediate manipulation of analysis data, cut and paste, and unlimited undo/redo. Hundreds of simultaneous partials can be synthesized in real-time and documents may contain thousands of individual partials dispersed in time. SPEAR also supports a variety of standard file formats for the import and export of analysis data.",

The piece is based on a dynamic digital score that follows pre-composed patterns depending on the weather at the location where it is being performed. The piece invites the outside world into the performance space, which is usually sterile to the elements. If the audience had to walk through a windy and rainy evening to get to a windowless, temperature controlled performance space, they will find that <i>Chance of Weather</i> evokes the gusts and the dampness of their day.

With its emphasis on folkloric collection, new Jewish music composition and performance, over time the Society included such young composers as Joseph Achron, Michail Gnesin, Alexander Krein, Moshe Milner, Solomon Rosowsky and Lazare Saminsky, among others, and it nurtured their work through its own publishing arm.Thanks to the efforts of Sam Zerin, a recent graduate of the University of Michigan and now a graduate student at New York University, and the generous cooperation of the Jewish Theological Seminary and Gratz College, and project advisors Judith Pinnolis and Paula Eisenstein-Baker, the full run of these scores, most of which are long since out of print, will now be available again, this time online, through the ASJM’s St. Petersburg Score Project. Making the St. Petersburg scores available, as well as the publications of the successor publishers, Juwal and Jibneh with offices in Berlin and Tel Aviv, not only provides important documentation of the work of Jewish composers during the early twentieth century, but will also provide access to these works for interested performers and scholars worldwide.",

Six work packages jointly worked out by four project partners focused on the work’s graphic, logical, and acoustic (or performative) domains, emphasizing at the same time a comprehensive and detailed data contextualization and the formalized linkage concepts required for this. Using MEI, the music-encoding standard for a comprehensive work in Common Western Music Notation (CMN), for the first time and pairing it with a TEI encoding of the verbal text elements opened up completely new possibilities of processing, enriching, and reusing data. By exploring the opportunities for linking to and segmenting audio recordings, the project attempted to contribute to the solution of generic issues in the acoustic field; by demonstrating the potential of its innovative digital-edition model, it endeavored to promote discussion of future edition forms and to encourage further basic research through exemplary investigations of the variance aspect.",

It empowers you to select the metrical Psalm texts and tunes that you would like to sing. However, once a tune and psalm text have been selected, the Digital Splitleaf Psalter underlays your selected text beneath the music as you would expect from a more traditional psalter or hymnal.

Two of Sarti's most successful Italian operas were edited, the Opera buffa <i>Fra i due litiganti il ​​terzo gode</i> (When two argue ...) and the Opera seria <i>Giulio Sabino</i>. The edition is a digital edition freely accessible via the Internet, which was created with the help of the tools of the Detmold Edirom project and the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI). The focus is on the presentation of selected different versions of each opera, which resulted from the processing of the works for new productions at other opera houses, as was common in the opera business of the late 18th century.",
